I write about topics in mathematics, statistics and {machine,deep} learning as I
work on them or learn about them.

Inspired by [Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca/), I write about things even
(especially) when I don't fully understand them. I'd love to learn
more about what I write about. Please help by leaving comments --
especially when I'm wrong.

### About me

I fell in love with Mathematics at an extremely young age. Nothing
satisfied my thirst. I eventually took my first college class when I
was 11 years old (in parallel, finishing elementary and then high
school). At the age of 20, I finished my M.Sc. in Mathematics, doing
research in [finite group
theory](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869304001863). Then
I (formally) stopped studying Mathematics and re-focused on my other
life-long love, software engineering.

I've been writing code professionally, on and off, for almost two
decades. Most recently, I was a very early employee at both
[Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) (building a javascript platform and frameworks)
and [Asana](https://asana.com/company) (building real-time
collaborative productivity software).

Right now I'm dedicating myself to studying statistics and machine
learning.  I'm especially interested in neural networks and their
applications.

### Some stuff I've worked on

* [The School of Mathematics](http://thewe.net/math/), where people from all backgrounds met
  to discover Mathematics through Socratic dialogue.
  Here's a [sample booklet](http://thewe.net/files/shapes_v2_web.pdf) I gave out to people.
* A large-scale C4I system for the Israeli Air Force
* A 3D graphics engine in pure assembly (sadly I lost the source code)
* [Conversations on Humankind](http://web.archive.org/web/20150726235949/http://www.meetup.com/Conversations-on-Humankind), a reading and discussion club. Inspired by the book "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind", we met to discuss chapters from books ranging from history, anthropology, psychology,
  economics and more.
* [TeX THE WORLD](http://thewe.net/tex), a browser plugin to render TeX everywhere
* A Google Wave data synchronization robot written in Clojure.
  Here's some [code](https://github.com/avital/thewe-clojure-relay/blob/master/clj/thewe.clj).
* [ShiftSpace](http://web.archive.org/web/20110628211734/http://www.shiftspace.org/),
  an open-source annotation layer on top of any website.

### This blog

I write about topics in statistics and {machine,deep} learning as I
work on them or learn about them.

Inspired by [Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca/), I plan to write about
things even (especially) when I don't fully understand them. I'd love
to learn more about anything I'm writing about, please help by leaving
comments -- especially when I'm wrong.

### About me

I took my first college class when I was 11 years old. When I was 20
years old, I finished my M.Sc. in Mathematics with a [single published
paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869304001863)
on conjugacy classes of finite groups. Then I stopped studying
Mathematics formally and re-focused on my other love, software
engineering.

I've been writing code professionally, on and off, for almost two
decades. My last two jobs were at
[Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) (a javascript platform and
framework) and at [Asana](https://asana.com/company) (real-time
collaborative productivity software).

Some stuff I've worked on:

* [The School of Mathematics](http://thewe.net/math/), where people from all background met
  to discover Mathematics through Socratic dialogue.
  Here's a [booklet](http://thewe.net/files/shapes_v2_web.pdf) I gave out to people.
* A large-scale C4I system for the Israeli Air Force
* Optimizing the assembly generation for the [P-Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-Cube)
  compiler (and tons of other compiler and embedded parts)
* A 3D graphics engine in pure assembly (sadly I lost the source code)
* [TeX THE WORLD](http://thewe.net/tex), a browser plugin to render TeX everywhere
* [Conversations on Humankind](http://web.archive.org/web/20150726235949/http://www.meetup.com/Conversations-on-Humankind). Inspired by the book "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind", we
  would meet every three weeks to discuss
  topics about the human condition -- ranging from history, anthropology, psychology,
  economics and more.
* [Formative](http://goformative.com), a system for teachers to share
  assignments with their students, seeing their results and giving them feedback live.
* [ShiftSpace](http://web.archive.org/web/20110628211734/http://www.shiftspace.org/),
  an open-source annotation layer on top of any website.
* A Google Wave data synchronization robot written in Clojure

I write about topics in mathematics, statistics and {machine,deep} learning as I
work on them or learn about them.

### About me

I'm current a Google Brain resident. Previous I interned at OpenAI.

I spent most of my early years studying and teaching mathematics,
culminating in an [M.Sc. in mathematics](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869304001863), a year as a visiting student at Rutgers, and founding an [informal school of mathematics](http://thewe.net/math).

I've also been a professional software engineer, on and off, for almost two
decades. Most recently, I was a very early employee at
[Meteor](https://meteor.com) (complete open-source javascript platform, over 35k stars on GitHub)
and [Asana](https://asana.com/company) (real-time
collaborative productivity software).

Right now I'm dedicating myself to studying statistics and machine
learning.  I'm especially interested in neural networks and Bayesian
inference.  I believe that the most robust methods and applications
arise from strong foundations. I try to find, understand and explain those
foundations.

### Some other stuff I've done

* A [sample booklet](http://thewe.net/files/shapes_v2_web.pdf) I used to recruit for my math cult.
* I created and coordinated [Conversations on Humankind](http://web.archive.org/web/20150726235949/http://www.meetup.com/Conversations-on-Humankind),
  a reading and discussion club. Inspired by the book ["Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095) (you should read it), we
  discussed chapters from books ranging from history, anthropology, psychology,
  economics and more.
* I built [TeX THE WORLD](http://thewe.net/tex), a browser plugin to render TeX everywhere
